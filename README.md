# Number Wordle Game: 

Just like Wordle you have to get a unknown word and get 5 tries to do it, similarly 

The game works as follows:
- Enter a number
- You give a range in which you want the number to be in (the larger the ranger, the harder the difficulty)
- The Game tells you whether your guess is higher or lower from the actual number by giving you a hint.
- By these hints, you need to guess the random number. 
- If you are able to guess it in 5 tries, you win otherwise you loose.

Enjoy!
